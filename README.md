# Dean Ward

**Lead Developer** based in Manchester, building scalable web applications and developer tools.

## What I'm Working On

**[Erugo](https://github.com/ErugoOSS/Erugo)** - A powerful, self-hosted file-sharing platform that puts you in control of your data. Built with Laravel and Vue.js, featuring human-friendly share links, secure access controls, and Docker deployment. Join the [community on Discord](https://discord.gg/M74X2wmqY8).

**[HAL](https://github.com/DeanWard/HAL)** - HTTP API Layer for Large Language Models. An MCP server that enables LLMs to interact with web APIs securely, with automatic OpenAPI tool generation and sophisticated secret management.

## Tech Stack

**Backend:** PHP, Laravel, Node.js, TypeScript  
**Frontend:** Vue.js, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3  
**DevOps:** Docker, Docker Compose  
**Databases:** MySQL, SQLite  
**Architecture:** REST APIs, MCP (Model Context Protocol)

## Open Source Philosophy

I believe in building tools that solve real problems and sharing them with the community. My projects focus on:

- **Developer Experience** - Tools should be easy to deploy and configure
- **Security First** - Proper authentication, authorization, and secret management
- **Self-Hosting** - Give users control over their data and infrastructure
- **Clean Code** - Maintainable, well-documented solutions

## Currently Exploring

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and the intersection of AI tooling with traditional web development. Interested in how we can bridge the gap between LLMs and existing web infrastructure.
