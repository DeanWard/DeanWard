> Building tools that solve real problems and sharing them with the community.

### Core Principles

▸ **Developer Experience First** - Tools should be intuitive and well-documented
▸ **Security by Design** - Proper authentication and authorization from day one  
▸ **Self-Hosting Friendly** - Give users control over their data and infrastructure
▸ **Open Source** - Knowledge should be shared and accessible

## Currently Exploring

Investigating Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and how they bridge the gap between AI and traditional web infrastructure. Particularly interested in:

- LLM integration patterns for existing applications
- Secure API access management for AI systems
- Developer tooling for the AI-enabled web
